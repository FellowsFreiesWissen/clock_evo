## It starts to cycle
[Last week](https://github.com/schmelling/clock_evo/blob/master/open_notebook/2017-02-06-first-results.md) I showed some preliminary results. Talking to Charles and the lab, we thought it is odd that the punishment environment performs so much worse than the cyclic. It turned out that the resource availability is a challenge for the sensing instructions. The organisms are able to correctly sense the resource, however, not the amount that is changing. I thought they would recognize that the levels are changing and then link that to the punishment. For the organism, however, the resource is always available and even though there is some punishment it results in a net positive for them. We thought that a cue resource that can be sensed, but is not used, would be a good idea. It tested that and indeed it changed the results drastically. Now I had three resources, one that is only sensed and two that are always available in infinite amounts. I had the feeling that it makes no sense to keep the two infinite resource, and I also feared that one sensing resource would bias towards these reaction that rewarded in the same cycle as the sensing resource. To overcome both issues, I deleted the sensing resource and instead set the other two resources as sensing resources. All reaction are now no longer dependent on a substrate. Before, even though they were, it made no difference because the resources were always available. With the new settings I could reduce the number of different environments from four to two and also had a lot of overlap between punishment and cyclic environments. In principle, I now have either a punishment or a no reward environment, both of which are cyclic. In the following, I will show some new preliminary results and discuss some issues and further ideas.

### Parameters
In the following I list the different parameter sets I use for each environment. Again, you can skip that part, if your not interested in the details.

### Results
**Reactions & Different Cycle Length**      
Changing to two sensing resources and no restrictions for the reaction other than the cyclic rewards and the amount of reactions that are rewarded, had a remarkable effect on the behaviour. The previous results showed 10% difference between cycles in the cyclic environment, which was the maximum in all studied environments. Now the changes are much higher.

![Figure 1](../data_analysis/reactions_cyclic_vs_punishment(n=50).pdf)

This has two reasons:
1. the reduced amount of reaction that rewarded (`max_count=1`). This causes the higher change in the cyclic environment. It simply increases the pressure to perform the right task at the right time.
2. the increase in changes within the organisms of the punishment environments suggests that the sensing of the resources now works as suppose to.
Another aspect, which still lowers the change between reaction count levels, is two updates cycle. A longer cycle length would give the organisms more time to change their metabolism and, in fact, is increasing the reaction level difference between cycles. The longer the cycles are the stronger the difference. *The maximum cycle length is 10 update, because this is equal to one generation in the punishment environment.*

**React Instead of Anticipate**       
If we take a closer look at the last 50 updates, we see that both, the cyclic and the punishment environment, behave similar in regard to when they switch their metabolism. Both switch after or at the time the sensing resource occurs. Even in environments with longer cycles they do not anticipate, ie. start before the resource is available to increase the reaction count. I'm not sure if I interpret the data correctly or if I simply need to run longer experiments. These experiments are run for 100,000 updates, but even 200,000 does not change the results. I need to discuss this issue with Charles and see if he has an idea about that. I could also be that the punishment in not strong enough, but I would doubt that at the moment, because even slight fitness differences between organisms should make a difference in the long term. I rather would think that this strategy (in this setting) is maybe more beneficial than to anticipate the change.

### Open Problems
* Differences between punishments (-0.1 & -0.2, -0.5 & -1, MULT -1, or even all -5)
* Organisms react instead of anticipate
* Competition between cyclic and punishment environment
