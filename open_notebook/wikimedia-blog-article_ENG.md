# Self-learning Computer Programs and Evolution

Computers play an increasing role in today’s society. On the one hand, we are actively using computers on a daily basis for various applications ranging from your alarm clock up to acquisition of new knowledge. On the other hand, computers are controlling an increasing amount of tasks without our contribution, e.g. your spam filter that removes unwanted emails. With an eye towards the future, we will see that computers taking over a large part of our work. A detailed examination of this topic was conducted in last year’s ARD thematic week about "[Zukunft der Arbeit](http://www.ard.de/home/themenwoche/ARD_Themenwoche_2016_Zukunft_der_Arbeit/3234726/index.html)" (Future of work).

A large proportion, thereby, is the ability of computers to “learn” through information and data. Applications of this ability are found in different areas, i.e. the recommendation to buy something in an online shop or usage in self-driving cars. In an era in which computer make data driven predictions, it should be possible to create new knowledge that way and solve scientific problems.

In my project, I want to answer questions of evolution using small, autonomous computer programs. In detail, I will work on the evolution of time keeping mechanisms. Under what conditions can an “internal” clock evolve, anyway? Are those timing mechanisms beneficial for an organism? These are some questions I want to answer with the project.

## What are these "digital organisms"?

A problem in the research on evolution is time. Normally, evolution happens extremely slowly. Luckily, there are only three conditions that needs to be fulfilled in order for evolution to occur:

* [__Replication__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction), so the ability to reproduce and produce offspring.
* [__Variation__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation), so the possibility of change over time and differences between individuals.
* [__Competition__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(biology)), so the fight for resources and the pressure to outcompete a competitor.

All of the requirements are met with these computer programs. Furthermore, computers have additional advantages, i.e. speed and the convenience of data collection. This combination allows for a rapid investigation of evolutionary principles with large amounts of data.
Thus, in the center of my project are small, autonomous computer programs or “digital organisms”. When I talk about digital organisms, I refer to the organisms that are implemented in [Avida](http://www.ofria.com/pubs/2004OfriaEtAl.pdf), a platform for [computational evolution](https://youtu.be/ouF8wKxXWFQ).       
These digital organisms are in fact a quite abstract construct. However, if you look more closely at these computer programs, you will see that they are built on similar principles as seen in [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria).

Avida organisms have — like normal organisms — a genome, reproduce, and interact with their environment. The genome in Avida is comprised of a circular sequence of “instructions”. Instructions can have various associated functions, e.g. the sensing of resources in the surrounding environment or the copying of the genome. __Reproduction__ is, in the most simplistic form, __asexual__ by the __duplication of the genome__ and subsequent __division into two organisms__. Thus the first requirement for evolution is fulfilled.
During reproduction, as also seen in nature, __copy errors__ or the __deletion/insertion of genomic content__ can occur. These mutations cause the __variation__ between individual digital organisms and thus fulfill the second requirement for evolution.       

How is the third requirement for evolution, the competition between organisms, implemented in Avida? In the simplest form, digital organisms are fighting for space. There is only a limited amount of space in the Avida world and once all of it is occupied, newly born organisms replace other existing organisms. So it is a race for space to live in. The only chance to ensure the survival of its species is to reproduce faster and more often. This opens up the second level of competition, namely the competition for computer time. At the beginning every organism has the same time to perform instructions. All organisms are equally fast and reproduce at the same speed. The only way the get more computer time is to solve logic tasks, e.g. calculations. A correct result will earn the organism a bonus. The harder the performed task, the higher will the benefit normally be. This represents the third level of competition. In summary, __competition__ is described by the __fight for living space, computer time, and complexity of tasks__.
Further information and applications of Avida can be found in the [articel](http://discovermagazine.com/2005/feb/cover/#.URRxZOjZrbI) by Carl Zimmer or the comprehensive [publication](http://www.ofria.com/pubs/2004OfriaEtAl.pdf) by Charles Ofria and Claus Wilke.

## When your interal clock gets out of balance

Everyone knows the phenomenon, when you have problems with waking up after switching to summer time. Or when you come back from your vacation in a foreign country and you need to readapt to your normal timezone. The cause for this phenomenon is your “internal” clock or circadian clock. The circadian clock helps the body to adjust to reoccurring daily changes. A prominent example is, as described earlier, the day-night cycle. The “internal” clock is also a central component of the organization of cells and whole organisms. It can be found in almost all life forms [10]; ranging from humans and other mammals over to plants and even unicellular organisms such as cyanobacteria. The question that arises is: What is the reason for such a clock?

Everyone knows the phenomenon, when you have problems with waking up after switching to summer time. Or when you come back from your vacation in a foreign country and you need to readapt to your normal timezone. The cause for this phenomenon is your “internal” clock or [circadian clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm). The circadian clock helps the body to adjust to reoccurring daily changes. A prominent example is, as described earlier, the day-night cycle. The “internal” clock is also a central component of the organization of cells and whole organisms. It can be found in almost all life forms  [[10](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000062)]; ranging from humans and other mammals over to plants and even unicellular organisms such as cyanobacteria. The question that arises is: What is the reason for such a clock? IIt could already exemplarily been shown that a circadian clock provides a fitness advantage for its organism [[11](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8386795_The_adaptive_value_of_circadian_clocks_An_experimental_assessment_in_cyanobacteria)]. This advantage is, however, only visible under oscillating conditions, such as a day-night cycle.
How did a world had to look like that promoted the evolution of such a regulatory mechanism? The evolution of the first circadian clock goes back billion of years [[10](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000062)]. However, the differences between the known forms of circadian clocks are so large that multiple evolutions of these clocks are very likely [[10](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000062)]. In my project I want to answer these questions about the evolution of these “internal clocks”.

I want to understand the influence of certain parameters, such as the length of day, on the evolution of circadian clocks. Is it important that the length of day and night are constant and similar over the course of a year, similar to the equatorial zone, or can a clock evolve on a hemisphere with changing day lengths and seasons? As soon as I have a better understanding about the environmental conditions for the evolution of a circadian clock, I want to investigate how these clocks change the fitness of the organism in competition with other organisms. How beneficial are circadian clocks compared to organisms without a clock or even organisms with a differently adapted clock?

## Open research process for anyone

The project is part of the [fellow program "Freies Wissen"](https://wikimedia.de/wiki/BildungWissenschaftKultur/Fellowprogramm), which was initiated by Wikimedia and the Stifterverband. The goal of this fellow program is to support young researches to open up their research and allow for an open scientific process. I decided to use the fellowship to start a new project and to work as open as possible. To facilitate participation in the project, I chose [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub), an online platform for collaborative software projects. The critical factor for choosing GitHub as the center for the project is the [version control](version control systems wiki) of contents through the version control system [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). Furthermore, GitHub has additional tools. Both the code, which underlies the experiments and data analysis, and the documentation of background and further information can be collected and edited. In addition, the issue tracker can be used for discussing problems and questions in the open. I [use](https://github.com/schmelling/clock_evo) all of these possibilities of GitHub at the moment and also write an open lab notebook to put down progress and thoughts.
It is important to me that anyone can not only follow the progress of the project but also to actively participate. Therefore, I chose [Avida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida) (for the experiments) and the programming language [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) (for the data analysis), two open source solutions, which allow anyone to openly participate.

## Sideprojects

During the project two new side projects arose. While I was beginning with the project, a couple of question arose regarding the correct setup of scientific project on GitHub. Which license do I need, if any? What happens with my data and where do I store it? This lead to a new project, which tries to build a guide of similar projects on GitHub.
In addition, I’m using Python for my data analysis. However, I needed some kind of reference collection in order to help others that want to participate in the project with learning and using Python.
Both of these projects are also on GitHub as well as the main project, open for collaboration and insights.
